        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Julisa Diaz, I am 19 years old. I was born and raised in the San Fernando Valley in California. I am a first generation college student, who comes from a low income household. My parents immigrated from Mexico 23 years ago to give me and my siblings a better life, with endless opportunities. My family and I have always been united and believe that family comes before anything. We like to give back to those who are still in Mexico to assure they are not missing anything critical. In my childhood, I grew up in a household of nine, 6 siblings, my parents and myself. I am the middle child, two older sisters, two younger, an older brother and a younger one. Growing up my dream was always to become a pediatrician, so coming into college I was majoring in Biology. It was until after I took my first biology course that I realized, I didn't like the subject and although I did want to become a pediatrician, majoring in biology was not for me. My whole life, one of my greatest passions and subjects has always been math. I decided to change my major to Economics shortly after taking two courses and finding a great interest in it. Economics does involve math which was one of the reasons why I enjoy it. Because I am the first one in my household to go to college, my siblings always look up to me and have been so proud of where I am. My younger siblings look at me as an example of where they should, when they struggle in school they come for me for advice. It has been great having my siblings look at me as their role model.   <br><br>

        In high school, I was part of a club in which I was able to tutor high school students in math. This allowed me to learn a little myself and become more familiar with the material that was new to me. In this club I was able to prepare students and some of my classmates for quizzes and tests that were coming up. Now that I am in college, I am unsure what I want to do with my Economics degree however, my plan is to minor in Education, and possibly teach the subject of math later in my career. Starting sixth grade, I entered a program called Project Grad Los Angeles (PGLA), a non-profit organization meant to spread college awareness to first generation college students. Up to this date I am still part of this program. I have participated with this program to speak to young kids about what college is about. I have held a panel at UCR to give them an insight of my experience. With PGLA I have been able to give back to my community by helping first generation students find their right path, learn about their options, and keep them informed.  <br><br>

        From a very young age I have always viewed myself as an achiever. I always strive to reach my goals, one of my most proudest achievements, has been to be where I am today. I have my own apartment, go to school, and am able to provide for myself. Although starting off my journey in college there has been a lot of rough times, there is always a way to overcome. I started working at JCPenney as a seasonal worker. Shortly after the holidays were coming to an end my worst fear was to be let go. I would then have to find another job, however I tried my best, provided great customer service, finished my task, and worked hard to keep this job. When I found out I was going to be able to stay I was happy. One of my best traits is that I am very humble, aside from all my achievements, I like to keep things to myself. I am now excited to see what life after college has for me, I know that whatever it is I will strive to be on top, the best I can be.
